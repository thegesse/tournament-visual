# 16 person Tournament visualiser code
---

## about
### A simple code project for the js module, were I had to make a tournament bracket with 16 participants and watch them compete for first place.
### The values are pre set so the result will always be the same though, I wanted to make it random but decided it would be easier this way.
### The html and css is made with ai as it isnt the focus of this project, I do apologize in advance for that

## How to use it
### It's simple, press the "Initialiser" button to start the bracket up, you will get to see all the participants and their level of athletecism. Then to start the bracket press the "Lancer" button and let it play out, you will see the winners move on to the next round and eventually the winner of the tournament. Finally if you want to reset, clear the alert that pops up with the winner of the tournament then press the "Reset" button to make the bracket again then the "Lancer" button again, and so on.
